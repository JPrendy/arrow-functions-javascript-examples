//This is an example of an arow function 
//test(3) is the equivalent of test = (param)  and there is no need to write a return function unless
//you use curly brackets 
var test = (param) => param + 2;
console.log("this is for the var test " + test(3));

//if you want to use curly brackets with arrow functions, you will have type return in order to return the arrow
//functions value
var test2 = (param) => { return param * 3};
console.log("this is for the var test2 " + test2(4));

//parentheses () are optional when there is only value like param, so the following will work
var test3 = param => param - 3;
console.log("this is for the var test3 " + test3(8));

//however we need parentheses () when there are multiple values
var test4 = (param, param2) => param + param2 + 10;
console.log("this is for the var test4 that has multiple values " + test4(8,10));


//Now this is some other code to test our knowledge this will create a new array for test5 and add three to each value
var array1 = [10, 4, 5, 6];
var test5 = array1.map((param) => param + 3);
console.log("this is for the var test5 that has array.map test using arrow functions " + test5);

//If done in a normal function format, it would look something like the following
var array1 = [15, 7, 8, 9];
var test6 = array1.map(function(param){ 
    return param + 3
    });
console.log("this is for the var test6 that has array.map using a normal function" + test6);
